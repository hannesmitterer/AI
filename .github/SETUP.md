# Setup Guide for Repository Automation

This guide will help you complete the setup of the automated repository management system.

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

The following automation has been added to the repository:

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows

Four comprehensive workflows have been created:

- **CI Workflow** (`ci.yml`)
  - Runs on every push and pull request
  - Validates repository structure, HTML files, security
  - Checks for exposed credentials and file sizes

- **Landing Page Verification** (`landing-page-verification.yml`)
  - Validates `index.html` structure and KOSYMBIOSIS elements
  - Ensures JavaScript functions are present
  - Checks CSS theme consistency

- **Documentation Check** (`documentation-check.yml`)
  - Validates README.md content
  - Ensures binary asset is documented
  - Calculates and verifies binary checksums

- **GitHub Pages Deployment** (`deploy-pages.yml`)
  - Automatically deploys to GitHub Pages on main branch updates
  - Creates deployment manifest with checksums
  - Verifies binary integrity before deployment

### 2. Documentation

- **Branch Protection Guide** (`.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md`)
  - Detailed instructions for configuring branch protection
  - Recommended settings for the main branch
  - Security best practices

- **Workflows README** (`.github/workflows/README.md`)
  - Complete documentation of all workflows
  - Local testing instructions
  - Troubleshooting guide

### 3. Repository Configuration

- **.gitignore** - Prevents committing build artifacts and temporary files
- **Updated README.md** - Documents all automation and includes status badges

## 📋 Manual Steps Required

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: GitHub Actions
3. Save the settings

The deployment workflow will automatically deploy the site on the next push to main.

### Step 2: Configure Branch Protection Rules

Since branch protection cannot be configured via code, you need to set it up manually:

1. Go to repository Settings → Branches
2. Click "Add branch protection rule"
3. Configure as follows:

   **Branch name pattern:** `main`

   **Protect matching branches:**
   - ✅ Require a pull request before merging
     - Required approving reviews: 1
     - ✅ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
     - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
     - Required status checks (add these after first workflow run):
       - `ci-checks`
       - `verify-landing-page`
       - `check-documentation`
   
   - ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
   
   - ❌ Do not allow bypassing the above settings
   
   - ❌ Allow force pushes (keep disabled)
   
   - ❌ Allow deletions (keep disabled)

4. Click "Create" or "Save changes"

**Note:** Status checks will only appear in the list after they run at least once. You may need to:
1. Merge this PR first
2. Let the workflows run
3. Then add them as required checks

### Step 3: Verify Workflows

After merging this PR:

1. Go to the Actions tab
2. Verify all workflows completed successfully
3. Check that status badges in README show passing status

### Step 4: Test Branch Protection

1. Try to push directly to main (should fail)
2. Create a test PR
3. Verify all checks run
4. Confirm merging is blocked until checks pass

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

After completing the manual steps:

- [ ] GitHub Pages is enabled and set to use GitHub Actions
- [ ] Branch protection is configured for main branch
- [ ] All required status checks are enabled
- [ ] Force pushes are disabled
- [ ] Branch deletions are disabled
- [ ] Direct pushes to main are blocked
- [ ] All workflows run successfully on push
- [ ] Status badges in README are visible
- [ ] Site is deployed to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Deployment manifest is accessible

## 🚀 What Happens Next

Once setup is complete:

1. **Every Pull Request** will:
   - Run CI checks
   - Validate landing page (if changed)
   - Check documentation consistency (if changed)
   - Block merging if any check fails

2. **Every Merge to Main** will:
   - Trigger automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
   - Create deployment manifest with checksums
   - Verify binary integrity

3. **Security**:
   - Direct pushes to main are blocked
   - All changes require review
   - Binary checksums are verified on every deployment

## 📊 Monitoring

### View Workflow Status
- Navigate to Actions tab
- Click on individual workflows to see run history
- Check logs for any failures

### View Deployment Status
- Go to Settings → Pages
- Click on latest deployment URL
- Verify site loads correctly
- Check manifest: `https://<your-pages-url>/manifest.json`

### Check Binary Integrity
The current binary checksum is:
```
ad191eaed965a47cb6cf75a3b319b5af015fb9757b0d96beb1038a31f72bb069
```

This is verified on every deployment and stored in the manifest.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Workflows Don't Appear in Branch Protection
- Workflows must run at least once before they appear in the list
- Merge this PR first, then add them as required checks

### GitHub Pages Deployment Fails
- Ensure Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Check that source is set to "GitHub Actions"
- Review deployment logs in Actions tab

### Status Checks Don't Run
- Verify workflow files are in `.github/workflows/`
- Check YAML syntax is valid
- Ensure trigger conditions are met (correct branch, file paths)
